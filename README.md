# Homework 03 JavaScript: Password Generator -  Andrew Friedman
(nu-chi-fsf-pt-01-2021-u-c)

The password generator's javascript code was updated to properly perform a number of functions consistent with the user experience and objectives set forth in the assignment.

The page now performs the following functions:
The user is invited to click the generate password button.
The user is presented with a prompt to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
If the user entered a value within these parameters, the user was met with the next series of window confirms: "Include special characters?," "Include lower case characters?," "Include upper case characters?," and "Include numbers?" one after another. The advancement from one window confirm to the next would occur when the user clicked either "cancel" or "Okay." Each of these user preferences would be recorded and included in character options in the code along with the password length.
If, however, the user did not input a valid entry into the password length field of the original prompt, the prompt would appear again and again until a valid value was entered before going on to the window confirms. Only the valid value of password length would be used in the character options preferences.

The password is generated by consulting the character options selected by the user, referencing the arrays of characters associated with each character preference, (true or false for the aforementioned window confirms to concatinate), and the random index was created using math floor and math random functionality times the character options and length preference.


Finally, the resulting password is displayed on the screen in the "password box." 

The user can once again click the generate password button, enter a new set of preferences in response to the prompt and window confirms, and be presented with a freshly generated password with these new preferences.
